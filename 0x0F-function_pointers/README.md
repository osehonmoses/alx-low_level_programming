In C, like normal data pointers (int *, char *, etc), we can have pointers to functions. Following is a simple example that shows declaration and function call using function pointer.

Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.

Unlike normal pointers, we do not allocate de-allocate memory using function pointers.

 A function’s name can also be used to get functions’ address. For example, in the below program, we have removed address operator ‘&’ in assignment. We have also changed function call by removing *, the program still works.

in this task will will be looking at the way to solve;
printing a name
creating a function that function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
writing a function that searches for an integer.
writing a program that performs simple operations
